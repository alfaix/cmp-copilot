# cmp-copilot
copilot.vim source for nvim-cmp

# Usage

```lua
cmp.setup {
  sources = {
    { name = 'copilot' }
  }
}
```

# Warning

1. This is experimental product.

I guess copilot.vim is early stage preview.
So this plugin might be corrupt if the breaking changes are applied to copilot.vim.

2. I don't support to use this for now

The reason I created this was just because I was interested it.
